A tool to keep track of the number of rows I've knitted of various charts and/or patterns.

Similar extant tools have intrusive ads and/or too many unnecessary features for my liking. Since knitting is already complicated enough, I sought to make something barebones.

Each counter is saved to and loaded from `localStorage` for extra simplicity.

Made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
