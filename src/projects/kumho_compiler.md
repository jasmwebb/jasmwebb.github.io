This command-line program, written in **Python**, automates the process of synthesizing a large volume of data (i.e., thousands of .DAT files) into meaningful graphs — work that was previously done manually and tediously.

Written for the associates of Kumho Eng, Inc., and submitted as a final project for Harvard University’s [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).
