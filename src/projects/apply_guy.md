*Friendship ended with spreadsheets. Now Apply Guy is my best friend.*

I wanted a way to keep track of my and my partner's job hunt progress that wasn't just a boring spreadsheet, so this **CRUD** application was born.

Frontend built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/); backend (authentication and database) served by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
