The simplest analogy would be *Yelp for K-Pop Stans*.

A one-stop resource to locate and bookmark cafes, restaurants, etc. associated with popular Korean Pop idols. K-Pop fans who are planning a trip to Korea have a covenient way to access this information in one place, as opposed to having to piece it together from several fan sites, the number of which grows exponentially by the number of groups the fan supports.

This is a collaborative project that currently has no code; but we are designing K-STAN as a **JAMstack** application.
