My first year participating in Advent of Code; all of my solutions were written in **Python**.

This was a fun challenge in problem solving, utilizing appropriate data structures, implementing test suites (although I didn't think to do that until the last few days), and catching up. Lots of catching up.

I look forward to saving Christmas all over again next year.
